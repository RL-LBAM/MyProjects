# MyProjects
Thanks for your visit. This is a collection of Zeping Li's project reports. The repository of each project's codes and datasets (if have) can be found in the corresponding report. Github sometimes does not render the files successfully, you can directly download the files if you are still interested.

The correspondence between projects and file names is as follows:

Modelling Object Co-Occurences in Images -- Modeling object co-occurrences.pdf

Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Hybrid Query Strategies -- DBAL with hybrid queries.pdf

Human Probability Judgments: A Bayesian Sequential Sampler Account -- Bayesian sequential sampler.pdf

Human Choices in Two-Armed Bandit Problems: Reinforcement Learning and Win-Stay-Loss-Shift Heuristics -- bandit problems_Chinese version.pdf (Note, this is a Chinese report with an Engish abstract. The choices are called decisions from experience in this report and most psychological literature).
