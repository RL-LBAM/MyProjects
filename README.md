# MyProjects
Thanks for your visit. This is a collection of Zeping Li's project reports. I upload them here rather than arxiv since my universities do not encourge me to do that. The repository of each project's codes and datasets (if have) can be found in the corresponding report. Github sometimes does not render the files successfully, you can directly download the files if you are still interested.

The correspondence between projects and file names is as follows:

Modelling Object Co-Occurences in Images -- Modeling object co-occurrences.pdf

Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Hybrid Query Strategies -- DBAL with hybrid queries.pdf

Human Probability Judgments: A Bayesian Sequential Sampler Account -- Bayesian sequential sampler.pdf

Human Choices in Two-Armed Bandit Problems: Reinforcement Learning and Win-Stay-Loss-Shift Heuristics -- bandit problems_Chinese version.pdf (Note, this is a translated version of my work powered by GPT-4 after a rough manual check. There are numerous remaining grammar errors and incoherence, but I hope the readers can get the general idea. The file name is misleading, but for those proficient in Chinese, please read bandit problems_Chinese version2.pdf, which is the original version)
